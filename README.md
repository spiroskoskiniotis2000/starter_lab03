**TODO - Update your name in this readme. Leave 1 space after the ## to preserve the text formating**


## Problem statement:
Write a MIPS assembly program which searches for a string in a sorted array using recursive binary search and
returns the memory address or 0, if not found. You also need to write the strcmp subroutine which compares two strings.
 
## Files to work on
* `lab03.asm` 
* `README.md` to add your name<br/>
Please **DO NOT MODIFY** any other files. 
      
## Running 
* To run the program interactively, start MARS: `java -jar MarsMYY505_4_5.jar`, and load the .asm file
* To run the test using munit: <br/>
```
    javac -cp munit.jar Lab03TestRecBsearch.java
    java -jar munit.jar lab03.asm Lab03TestRecBsearch.class
```

## Automatic testing 
Every commit pushed is automatically tested, by running the above commands on a virtual machine.
To view the test results, click on the "Actions" tab and you will see the list of commits.
Next to each commit there will be a red x if the test fails, or a green tick, if it passes. Click on a commit name and then "Autograding", on the left. You can then expand the logs (little ">"s in the dark area of the window) to view the error messages.
